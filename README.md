**Aim of the project**: device capable of counting the number of movements made during a physical activity

The system consists of two devices communicating via Bluetooth, each using a different SPI and I2C communication protocol to allow data to be transferred to and from additional boards that have been connected to the main device to add additional functionality such as motion detection and visual feedback.
  
 **First device:**
  
 \-BGM220 acquires data from the pad
 
 \-The MPU 9DOF click plate has a 9-axis inertial sensor combining a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer.

  **Second device:**
 
 \-BGM220 acquires data from the pad.

 \-The 7seg click pad contains a numerical display to monitor the data.
